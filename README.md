# ROS/ROS2 node for unite-imu method

This is ROS1/ROS2 node for 
* interpolating accelerometer value into gyrometer value which has higher frequency
* fusing interpolated accel and gyro value into single imu topic

I have tested this code in 
* Ubuntu 20.04
* ROS noetic/ROS2 foxy

For each package for ROS1 and ROS2, please refer to directory `ros1` and `ros2`.
